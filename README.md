# Climatic, Environmental, and Demographic Determinants over Fifteen Years of Dengue Case Reports in Caribbean Santa Marta, Colombia

This repository contains the code used in the analyses supporting the manuscript:

**“Climatic, Environmental, and Demographic Determinants over Fifteen Years of Dengue Case Reports in Caribbean Santa Marta, Colombia.”**

## Scope
The repository provides all scripts and notebooks required to reproduce the analytical workflow of the study.  
Raw epidemiological and demographic data, as well as generated figures, are not publicly shared due to data use restrictions.

## Contents
- `scripts/R/`: R scripts for descriptive analysis, population density estimation, lag calculation, and statistical modeling
- `notebooks/`: Python/Jupyter notebooks for remote sensing data extraction
- `environment/`: R session information for reproducibility

## Analysis workflow
1. Remote sensing data extraction (MODIS land surface temperature and precipitation)
2. Descriptive analysis of dengue cases and covariates
3. Population density estimation
4. Lagged variable calculation
5. Statistical modeling

## Data availability
The datasets analyzed in this study are not publicly available due to ethical and institutional restrictions but may be available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.

## Code availability
All code used in the analyses is publicly available in this repository.
